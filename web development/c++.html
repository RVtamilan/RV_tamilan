        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
       <ul> <li>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same </li></ul>
        <h2>Features & Key-points </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.</li>
            <li>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent: A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.</li>
            <li>Mid-level language: It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</li>
            <li>Rich library support: Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.</li>
            <li>Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.</li>
            <li>Pointer and direct Memory-Access: C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).</li>
            <li>Object-Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.</li>
            <li>Compiled Language: C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use Of C++</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>C++ is a fast and strongly-typed programming language which makes it an ideal choice for developing operating systems. Mac OS X has large amounts written in C++. Most of the software from Microsoft like Windows, Microsoft Office, IDE Visual Studio, and Internet Explorer are also written in C++.</li>
            <li>Since C++ is closer to hardware, game development companies use it as their primary choice to develop gaming systems. It can easily manipulate resources and can override the complexities of 3D games and multiplayer networking</li>
            <li>C++ is also used to develop GUI-based and desktop applications. Most of the applications from Adobe such as Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. are developed using C++</li>
            <li>Web browsers need to be fast in execution as people do not like to wait for their web pages to be loaded. This is why most browsers are developed in C++ for rendering purposes. Mozilla Firefox is completely developed from C++. Google applications like Chrome and Google File System are partly written in C++</li>
            <li>Various embedded systems that require the program to be closer to hardware such as smartwatches, medical equipment systems, etc., are developed in C++. It can provide a lot of low-level function calls, unlike other high-level programming languages</li>
            <li>Since banking applications require concurrency, multi-threading, concurrency, and high performance, C++ is the default choice of programming language. Infosys Finacle is a popular banking application developed using C++</li>
            <li>Cloud storage systems that are used extensively need to work closer to the hardware. This makes C++ the default choice for implementing cloud storage systems. These systems also require multithreading support to build concurrent applications that support load tolerance, which C++ provides. Bloomberg is a distributed RDBMS application that is primarily written in C, but its development environment and set of libraries are all written with C++.</li>
            <li>etc..</li>
